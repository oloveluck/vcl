;;; docs-test.rkt — the manual (scribblings/vcl.scrbl) builds: it reads, expands and renders, and no
;;; cross-reference to this package's own definitions is broken. (Rendered alone, without the
;;; installation's documentation index, links into Racket's own manuals are unresolved; those are
;;; not counted.) A manual that failed to read went unnoticed once; this is the guard.
